# Alpha-Blog-Ruby

This application was my first application built from the ground up with Ruby/Ruby on Rails 6.

The application allows for users to create article entrys, and once they're created, view, edit and delete them. This site has been styled with Bootstrap 4 elements.  

# TECHNOLOGIES USED

HTML, SCSS, Bootstrap 4, Ruby, Ruby On Rails 6, Git, Heroku.
